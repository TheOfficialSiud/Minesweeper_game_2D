# Minesweeper_game_2D
I have created the Minesweeper game using unity handler and add the functionalities using c#.

To run the game download the game zip folder and extract it in local drive.
now run the (New Unity Project (5).exe) file.

you can also select the level of difficulty inside the game using buttons.
